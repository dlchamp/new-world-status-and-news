How to get your webhook url - https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
Paste your discord webhook channel URLs into the two variables below
If you wish for there to only be one channel for both server status and game news (patch notes),
make leave news_webhook_url = server_status_webhook_url
'''
server_status_webhook_url = 'discord-web-hook-url'
# Add second webhook url if you wish to send news messages to a different channel
news_webhook_url = server_status_webhook_url
'''
Set your list of 1 or more servers you wish to monitor
Assign a mention role, if you wish - Get your ID by typing \@role-you-wish-to-mention.  Copy the full ID (ex: <@&8997895432165879>)
and paste between the ''.  If you don't wish to have a role, just replace 'role-mention-id' with None (ex: mention_role = None)
'''
monitored_servers = ['Valgrind', 'Emain Albach', 'Savoya']
mention_role = None  # Mention role or use None (no quotes)
